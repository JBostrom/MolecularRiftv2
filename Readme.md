<h2>FAQ</h2>

Question: Can I use the latest version of the (Unity, Oculus Runtime, Leap Motion) SDK’s?
Answer: Probably not, use all the versions specified above.
 
Question: I don't see any molecules/proteins, just a background image. Why is that?
Answer: You probably don't have openbabel installed correctly. Please check your installation.
 
Question: After installing Oculus Runtime 1.3, the graphics (especially details) is distorted at longer distances. Can I improve the graphics?
Answer: Yes you can! This is due to something known as supersampling. Here's a good description of how to improve graphics on Oculus Rift: http://www.roadtovr.com/improve-oculus-rift-game-image-quality-using-this-tool-oculus-debug-tool/. Be sure to read the instructions and follow every step of it.
 
Question: It still doesn’t work. Any hints?
Answer: Make sure you pull down all files correctly (also the one from Github’s LSF), and that your computer meets the requirements.
